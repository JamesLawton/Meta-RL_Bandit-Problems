Learning to reinforcement learn

A repository for the purpose of recreating and expanding upon the experiments mentioned in Learning to Reinforcement Learn (Wang, et al. 2016)
Specifically, this repository focuses on the implementation of a series of bandit problems (easy, medium, and hard) for generalization purposes. Additionally, Meta-RL enables the agent to continue learning, even while the weights are frozen.

Implementation inspired from Arthur Juliani, please see [blog post](https://hackernoon.com/learning-policies-for-learning-policies-meta-reinforcement-learning-rl%C2%B2-in-tensorflow-b15b592a2ddf) for further details.
